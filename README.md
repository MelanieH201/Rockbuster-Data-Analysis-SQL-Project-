# Rockbuster-Data-Analysis-SQL-Project-
###### This section contains a SQL Project that I did while enrolled with Career Foundry. I was "hired" by a fictional company, Rockbuster Stealth, to help launch a strategy for a new online video service. I used SQL to analyze data to answer the company's key questions and presented the data through a powerpoint presentation. 
###### Key questions included the following:
###### 1. Which movies contributed to the most/least revenue gain? 
###### 2. What was the average rental duration for all videos? 
###### 3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? 
###### 4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based? 
###### 5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
