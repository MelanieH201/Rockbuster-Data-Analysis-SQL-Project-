# Rockbuster-Data-Analysis-SQL-Project-
This section contains a SQL Project that I did while enrolled with Career Foundry. I was "hired" by a fictional company, Rockbuster Stealth, to help launch a strategy for a new online video service. I used SQL to analyze data to answer the company's key questions and presented the data through a powerpoint presentation. 
Key questions included the following:
Which movies contributed to the most/least revenue gain? 
What was the average rental duration for all videos? 
Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? 
Where are customers with a high lifetime value based? 
Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
